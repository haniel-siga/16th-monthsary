		<p class="your-text">
			Hi Love! First, I wanna greet you a happy monthsary. <br>
			We've been together for 16 months now and I'm glad that we're still moving forward and continuing despite of all the challenges that we've been through. <br>
			I know that our relationship hasn't been steady and we had a lot of fights to the point that we said a lot of hurtful words, but I want you to know that after all those fights that we had, I'm only loving you more and more. <br>
			My love is growing deeper and deeper. <br>
			With this gift/virtual letter, I want to thank you for all the love and sacrifices you gave for our relationship, I want to thank you for still choosing me each and every day, throughout every challenges and fights. <br>
			I want you to know that I appreciate all of your efforts, big or small, all of that means a lot to me. I appreciate all of the things that you do, not only for me and our relationship, but also in your life.<br>
			I also want you to know that our relationship might go to the point that it's not gonna be easy and where everybody fails to choose, to the point where there is no spark anymore or that everything that we do will become only a routine, <br>
			like- the intensity is not there anymore, I want you to remember this one thing when that time comes, I will always love and choose you whatever happens.<br>
			Cause I know that even if the spark will not be anymore, you will always be the one that I want to live with for the rest of my days. <br>
			You will always be the one that I want to go home with, with our peaceful home, reaching our dreams, and living together what we dream of. I wanna grow with you, together. <br>
			I hope that this simple gift will say of how much I love you and appreciate you, may you appreciate yourself as well. I hope to have more monthsary and anniversary with you and I want you to remember that I will always love you, my Hani, my Love, my Future forever. <br>
			Mahal na mahal po kita, lalove. Happy 16th months po.
